# My Portfolio

## Description 
- I have created this application that will allow users to generate random passwords based on criteria that you have selected. The password generator will facilitate the password making process by taking away the lengthy process of actually coming up with a password. I have created this tool to help people across the globe strengthen their privacy credentials which will give them peace of mind for very little effort. Thanks to this application i have further improved my knowledge in Javascript specifically in regards to functions and variables.
